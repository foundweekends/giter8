### new management and Apache v2

This is the first release since the development is passed on to
[foundweekends][fw] project.

- We've relicensed Giter8 under Apache v2 license after contacting
  previous contributors and getting their approvals. [#194][194]
- Organization name is changed to `org.foundweekends.giter8`.
- The sbt plugins were renamed to `sbt-giter8` and `sbt-giter8-scaffold`.
- Created Pamflet [documentation][docs].

### bug fixes and improvements

- Better error handling when templates do not compile. [#193][193] by [@njlg][@njlg]
- Supports Git URLs that start with `ssh://`. [#192][192] by [@njlg][@njlg]
- Fixes sbt-giter8 not expanding dynamic default properties. [#165][165] by [@sattvik][@sattvik]
- `ls(..)` property is dropped. [#201][201] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### root layout

Giter8 0.7.0 introduces an *experimental* layout called *root layout*.
When Giter8 does not find `src/main/g8`, it will simply use the root directory
of the specified Git repository as the template directory.

The `default.properties` file can be placed either at the root directory
or in `project` directory.
This also means that you can no longer include template fields in the files
under `project`, so the application of root layout is pretty limited. [#202][202] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
