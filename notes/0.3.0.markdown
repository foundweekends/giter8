This release is brought to you [eed3si9n][eed3si9n].

### New features

[eed3si9n]: https://github.com/eed3si9n/

- giter8-plugin for sbt 0.11 with `g8-test` task, which runs
  `src/test/g8/test` using [scripted][scripted] framework.
- a directory named `$package$` expands out to package dir structure
  (for example, `net.databinder` becomes `net/databinder`). [#19][19]
- files matching the patterns listed in `verbatim` are copied without
  processing (for example, `verbatim: *.js` leaves js files
  alone). [#21][21]
