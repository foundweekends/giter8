This release adds a `search` command which uses the GitHub API to
search for repositories containing the given string, and ending with
".g8". Contributed by hadesgames in [PR #128][128].

    g8 search unfiltered

It also upgrades giter8 itself to Scala 2.10 (of interest to
anyone using it as a library) via [PR #111][111].
