Giter8
======

Giter8 is a command line tool to generate files and directories from
templates published on Github or any other git repository.
It's implemented in Scala and runs through the
[sbt launcher][launcher], but it can produce
output for any purpose.

### sbt new integration

Starting sbt 0.13.13, Giter8 can be called from sbt's ["new" command][new] as follows:

```
\$ sbt new eed3si9n/hello.g8
```

### Credits

- Original implementation (C) 2010-2015 Nathan Hamblen and contributors
- Adapted and extended in 2016 by foundweekends project
