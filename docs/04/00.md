Scaffolding plugin
------------------

Giter8 supplies an sbt plugin for creating and using scaffolds.

### Using the scaffold plugin

Add the following lines in `project/scaffold.sbt`

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.foundweekends.giter8" % "sbt-giter8-scaffold" % "$version$")
```

Once done, the  `g8Scaffold` command can be used in the sbt shell.
Use TAB completion to discover available templates.

```
> g8Scaffold <TAB>
controller   global       model
```

The template plugin will prompt each property that needed to complete the scaffolding process:

```
> g8Scaffold controller
className [Application]:
```


### Creating a scaffold

The g8 runtime looks for scaffolds in the `src/main/scaffolds` in the given Github project.
Each directory inside `src/main/scaffolds` is a different scaffold, and will be
accessible in the sbt shell using the directory name. Scaffold directories
may have a `default.properties` file to define field values, just like
ordinary templates. `name` is again a special field name: if it exists,
the scaffold will be generated into a directory based on `name`,
with subdirectories following the layout of the source scaffold directory.

Once a template as been used, scaffolds are stored into `<project_root>/.g8`

```
\$ ls sample/.g8
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   5 jtournay  staff   170B Aug  6 03:21 .
drwxr-xr-x  11 jtournay  staff   374B Aug  6 05:29 ..
drwxr-xr-x   4 jtournay  staff   136B Aug  6 03:21 controller
drwxr-xr-x   4 jtournay  staff   136B Aug  6 03:21 global
drwxr-xr-x   4 jtournay  staff   136B Aug  6 03:21 model
```

It's also possible to create your own scaffold in any sbt project by creating the `.g8` directory.
