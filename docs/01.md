Setup
-----

#### Coursier

Giter8 and other Scala command line tools can be installed using [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/). 
See the coursier [installation instruction](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) to add it to your path.
Once `cs` is on your path, you can install giter8 with this command:

    \$ cs install giter8

and update it using:

    \$ cs update g8

#### Manual

It's possible to manually download and install giter8 directly from Maven Central:

    \$ curl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/foundweekends/giter8/giter8-bootstrap_2.12/0.13.1/giter8-bootstrap_2.12-0.13.1.sh > ~/bin/g8
    \$ chmod +x ~/bin/g8

Replace `~/bin/` with anything that is on your `PATH`. To make sure everything is working, try running `g8` with no
parameters.
