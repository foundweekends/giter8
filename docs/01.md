Setup
-----

You can install Giter8 and other Scala command line tools with
[Conscript][cs]. This will setup Conscript in `~/.conscript/bin/cs`:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundweekends/conscript/master/setup.sh | sh

(See [Conscript's readme][cs] for a non-unixy option.) Once `cs` is
on your path, you can install (or upgrade) giter8 with this command:

    cs foundweekends/giter8

[cs]: http://www.foundweekends.org/conscript/setup.html

To make sure everything is working, try running `g8` with no
parameters. This should download giter8 and its dependencies, then print
a usage message.

When it's time to upgrade to a new version of giter8, just run the
same `cs` command again.

Giter8 is also installable with the OS X package manager [Homebrew][]:

    \$ brew update && brew install giter8

[Homebrew]: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
