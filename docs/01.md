Setup
-----

You can install Giter8 and other Scala command line tools with
[Coursier][coursier]'s `install` command:

    coursier install giter8

(See [Coursier's docs][coursier] for how to install it.)

[coursier]: https://get-coursier.io/

To make sure everything is working, try running `g8` with no
parameters. This should print a usage message.

When it's time to upgrade to a new version of giter8, just run
`coursier update giter8`.

Giter8 is also installable with the macOS package manager [Homebrew][]:

    \$ brew install giter8

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
