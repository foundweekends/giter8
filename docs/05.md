### Installing local version of giter8

When you're working on giter8 locally you probably want 
to try out your changes before you open a pull request. This is how you do it.

Giter8 uses [conscript] as distribution mechanism. You can find more documentation
about conscript on its [official page].

#### Fixing `PATH`:

Before you install giter8 with conscript, you need to ensure, that
conscript directory has higher precedence than default installation path.

You can either delete existing version of giter8, or change `$PATH` variable such that 
`~/.conscript/bin` is before.

#### To install local version:

- Change `g8version` in `build.sbt` i.e. by adding `"-SNAPSHOT"`;
- Run `publishLocal` from sbt;
- From a shell session run `cs --local foundweekends/giter8/<YOUR_VERSION>`. 
  Use the version number you just wrote in `build.sbt`.

#### To refresh:

- Run `publishLocal` from sbt again;
- From a shell session run `cs --clean-boot`.

#### To get back to normal version:

From a shell session run `cs foundweekends/g8`.
