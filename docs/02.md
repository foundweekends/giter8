Usage
-----

Template repositories must reside on github and be named with the
suffix `.g8`. We're keeping a [list of templates on the wiki][wiki].

To apply a template, for example, [unfiltered/unfiltered.g8][uft]:

[uft]: http://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered.g8
[wiki]: http://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/wiki/giter8-templates

    \$ g8 unfiltered/unfiltered.g8

Giter8 resolves this to the `unfiltered/unfiltered.g8`
repository and queries Github for the project's template
parameters.
Alternatively, you can also use a git repository full name

    \$ g8 https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered.g8.git

You'll be prompted for each parameter, with its default
value in square brackets:

    name [My Web Project]: 

Enter your own value or press enter to accept the default. After all
values have been supplied, giter8 fetches the templates, applies
the parameters, and writes them to your filesystem. 

If the template has a `name` parameter, it will be used to create base 
directory in the current directory (typical for a new project). 
Otherwise, giter8 will output its files and directories into 
the current directory, skipping over any files that already exist.

Once you become familiar with a template's parameters, you can enter
them on the command line and skip the interaction:

    \$ g8 unfiltered/unfiltered.g8 --name=my-new-website

Any unsupplied parameters are assigned their default values.

### Private Repositories

Giter8 will use your ssh key to access private repositories, just like git does.
